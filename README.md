## Development

### Release

#### [haya14busa/action-bumpr](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-bumpr)
You can bump version on merging Pull Requests with specific labels (bump:major,bump:minor,bump:patch).
Pushing tag manually by yourself also work.

#### [haya14busa/action-update-semver](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-update-semver)

This action updates major/minor release tags on a tag push. e.g. Update v1 and v1.2 tag when released v1.2.3.
